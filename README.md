This is my personal homepage. Nothing special, I just wanted to play around
with Jekyll. You can visit the page [here](https://yannickkirschen.github.io).

## Local Development

To start the server locally, you have to have Ruby installed. Then execute:

```shell script
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If you change something in `Gemfile`, make sure to run `bundle install` and
don't forget to check in `Gemfile.lock` as well!
