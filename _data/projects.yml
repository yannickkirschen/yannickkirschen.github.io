        *cli-args* is a Python library for an easier parsing of command line arguments.
        It wraps the popular *argparse* to
        allow importing parsed arguments from anywhere in the code. One of the key
        features is the way you define what arguments you accept. By providing a
        dictionary - that also can be read from a JSON file! - you can easily set all
        available command line arguments at one specific, easy-to-find place.
